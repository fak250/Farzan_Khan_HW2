		My trip to NYU Abu Dhabi was my first international trip and thus serves as an avenue to explore so many more cultures. Thanks to NYUAD's diverse student body I talked to and learned about many people from many different backgrounds. I also got to <a href=travel.html> travel</a> alot.I got to experiment academically and I eventually decided on doing an electrical engineering major.

		I climbed alot of sand-dunes both literal and metaphorical and despite the fact that its been an up and down experience so far, I have transformed for the better.
